        <p> Education is the road to national development. It creates sense of responsibility among the people. On the
          basis of education people not only realize their duties but also know how to achieve their national, societal
          and individual rights. One of the goals of education is to enable the people by enhancing their general
          consciousness regarding their national and international position as global citizens. This realization creates
          an atmosphere of trust and cooperation in the society. </p>
